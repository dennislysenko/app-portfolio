## Longer Bio Options

### Option A - Partnership Focus
> I partner with founders as their product right hand — helping shape strategy, then rolling up my sleeves to build and ship. Think of me as the execution layer between your vision and the App Store.

### Option B - Track Record Focus
> I've helped ship [X] apps to the App Store, working alongside founders from napkin sketch to launch. I bring both the strategic thinking and the technical chops to make products real.

### Option C - Problem/Solution Focus
> Most founders have more ideas than bandwidth. I help cut through the noise, prioritize what matters, and then actually build the thing. Strategy without execution is just a deck.

## Tone Notes

- Confident but not cocky
- Results-oriented (show, don't tell)
- Approachable, not corporate
- Technical credibility without jargon
- Partnership > vendor relationship
