## README Sync Directive

**Important:** The README.md file should always reflect the content displayed on the live site.

When making changes to the site content (particularly in `src/pages/index.astro` or site configuration), update the README.md to match. The README serves as a text-based mirror of the portfolio site, so visitors to the GitHub repo see the same information as visitors to the website.

Key sections to keep in sync:
- Hero section (name, title, tagline)
- Stats (years, apps shipped, revenue)
- Highlight reel items
- Project list (featured apps and the "plus X more" note)
- Off the Clock hobbies
- Contact information and links
