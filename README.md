## Off the Clock

- Diehard Arsenal fan. Yes, even through the banter years.
- Deep into health & longevity after a brutal year with long covid taught me not to take it for granted.
- Always scheming my next free flight. Ask me about credit card points.

## Let's Build Something

Currently have availability for 1-2 new projects.

Best fit: founders building iOS apps who want a partner, not just a contractor.

Most engagements start with a quick call to see if we're a good fit.
